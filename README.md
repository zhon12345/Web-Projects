# ðŸ—»ðŸ“ƒâœ‚ Rock Paper Scissors

This the classic Rock Paper Scissors game that you probably played as a kid. It is coded using [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) and [Vanilla JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/). Instead of playing with another user, you're playing a best out of 15 rounds game against a computer. You can view a live demo of this project [here](https://zhon12345-rps.netlify.app).
