# zhon12345's Web-Projects

Welcome, are you looking for my Web Projects? If you are, you're in the right place. Most are my projects are coded with [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) and [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) but some are coded with [React.js](https://reactjs.org). 

All my projects are available in the main branch but can be located in their respective branches as well. If you have problems locating the branches, there is a guide below.
