# Tetris Clone with React.js

This is a Tetris clone that is coded using [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can view a live demo of this project [here](https://zhon12345-tetris.netlify.app).

*Note: This is not created by me, I made this by following a tutorial on YouTube which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGOaCxX8HIU). This is not a complete copy either, I tweaked some of the code which allows you to use the `ASD` keys and `Arrow Keys` to move the blocks. Moreover, you can now use `Q` and `E` keys to rotate the blocks clockwise and anti-clockwise respectively instead of using the `ArrowUp` key.*
